"""Squash-merge detector.

Detects disconformities — single-parent commits that compressed multiple
logical changes into one, hiding the intermediary commit history.

Fix over v1:
- Tree-match is now the PRIMARY gate (strong signal only).
- File-count heuristic is demoted to a secondary, opt-in signal and
  requires a much higher threshold to avoid false positives on normal
  large commits.
- Severity is now driven by hidden commit count, not just file count.
